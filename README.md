# Arrow Entity Loot Drop

This mod makes Entities shot with Arrows drop them upon death!

This has always bugged me about Minecraft combat and makes Infinity feel like a requirement. Why does the game punish you for being accurate? Missed arrows can be recovered, why not hits?

NOTE: This mod makes no attempt to serialize the arrows contained by entities - as a result, server reboots will remove all entity-arrow data.
